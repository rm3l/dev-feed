Dev Feed is a Flutter-based mobile application allowing to keep up with top engineering content from
companies all over the world.
It stemmed from my own needs to not only follow a curated list of tech-related blogs, but also
play a little bit with the excellent [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) SDK.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack is rather simple:
* Backend
  * A [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), which contains scheduled crawlers in charge of analyzing certain remote websites for articles and feeding a local database. It then aggregates and exposes such data over a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API, with the ability to search for articles, or by tags, or to read past articles. This Backend application is published to the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rm3l/dev-feed), and continuously deployed to [Heroku](https://dev-feed-api.herokuapp.com/graphiql) as well. At the moment, articles are fetched from the list below, but additional sources may be added later on:
    * [DiscoverDev.io](https://www.discoverdev.io/)
    * [EngineeringBlogs.xyz](https://engineeringblogs.xyz/)
    * my own blog, located at [rm3l.org](https://rm3l.org)
* Mobile
  * A cross-platform mobile UI application written in [Dart](https://dart.dev/), using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) SDK. Please note that there is no sync'ing mechanism, and all search/favorite articles are stored on the local device. This is an enhancement that might be implemented later on.

### Building and running

#### Using the Backend GraphQL API

##### Docker

A Docker repository with the GraphQL API Server can be found here: https://hub.docker.com/r/rm3l/dev-feed-api

To fetch the docker image, run:

```bash
docker image pull rm3l/dev-feed-api
```

To run the server with the default options and expose it on port 8080:

```bash
docker container run --rm -p 8080:8080 rm3l/dev-feed-api
```

You can then access the GraphiQL browser by heading to http://localhost:8080/graphiql

##### Kubernetes

The Backend API is also published to [my Helm Charts repository](https://helm-charts.rm3l.org/), so as to be deployable to a Kubernetes Cluster using [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

It is listed on Artifact Hub : https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/rm3l/dev-feed

```bash
$ helm repo add rm3l https://helm-charts.rm3l.org
$ helm install my-dev-feed rm3l/dev-feed
```

See https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/rm3l/dev-feed or https://github.com/rm3l/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/dev-feed/README.md for
all customizable values.

You can then access the GraphiQL browser by heading to http://localhost:8080/graphiql

##### Manual mode

1. Build the Backend

```sh
./backend/gradlew -p ./backend build --stacktrace
```

2. Run the Backend GraphQL API

```sh
java -jar backend/api/build/libs/dev-feed-api-2.0.1.jar
```

You can then access the GraphiQL browser by heading to http://localhost:8080/graphiql

#### Using the Mobile application

1. Install Flutter by following the instructions on the [official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

2. Prepare the configuration environment

Skip this to use the default Heroku Backend. Otherwise, if you have a custom Backend (either local or remote), you need to create a specific environment file (say `my_personal_backend.dart`) in the `mobile/lib/environments` folder, e.g.:

```dart
import 'package:dev_feed/env.dart';

void main() => MyPersonalBackend();

class MyPersonalBackend extends Env {
  final String baseUrl = 'https://my-dev-feed-backend-api.example.org';
}
```

3. Build the mobile apps

First `cd` to the `mobile` directory:

```sh
cd mobile
```

If you simply want to target the default Heroku backend, just run:

```sh
flutter build apk --debug
```

Otherwise, if you have a custom Backend (and its related Dart environment file) declared under `mobile/lib/environments/my_personal_backend.dart`, then run:

```sh
flutter build apk --debug -t lib/environments/my_personal_backend.dart
```

You will then find the mobile applications built under the respective platform folders. For example, the APK for Android can be found under `build/app/outputs/apk/debug/`.

4. Install and run the APK either in an emulator or in a real device

```sh
flutter install
```

Or:

```sh
adb install -r build/app/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions and issue reporting are more than welcome. So to help out (e.g., with a new Article crawler plugin in the Backend), do feel free to fork this repo and open up a pull request.
I'll review and merge your changes as quickly as possible.

You can use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rm3l/awesome-dev/issues) to report bugs.
However, please make sure your description is clear enough and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.
